## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

- Initial bootstrap: `scitex-storage scan [PATH ...]` MVP — a read-only,
  stat-only walk reporting the biggest space and inode (file-count)
  consumers per top-level child of a root (defaults to `~/.scitex` and
  `~/proj`). Never follows symlinked directories, never reads file
  contents, never mutates anything.
